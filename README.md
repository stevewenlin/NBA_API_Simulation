This project was done on the topic of NBA basketball: the goal of this work is to predict outcomes of the 2019-2020 NBA season. 

For use, please refer to the numbers in front of the 5 Jupyer Notebooks in this Repo: through the notebooks in numerical orders. 

Findings: 

1) Players today have higher PERs than players of 10 years ago
2) Lebron James is an amazing player: having the best PER ever & also appearing 6/20 all times PERS in the last ~ 20 years
3) There are advanced metrics such as VA, EWA, +/-, PIE and more that should be implemented in further analysis 
4) Players with extremely high PER, +/-, team winning% will likely win the MVP 
5) Simuations are truly unbiased because it randomly samples distributions 
  
This work was done solo by Wen Lin, this was the best i can do given the time restraint.
